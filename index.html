    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Include everyone in security practices. The best practice for building secure software is called SecDevOps. 
        Adopt a cybersecurity framework. Automate and integrate security tools to make sure less manual work is needed, issues can be found earlier and tracked effectively. 
        Follow secure software development practices that help you make fewer errors when writing code and helps you detect and eliminate errors earlier. 
        Use diverse security measures. Integrate them with our entire environment and automate as much as possible. 
        Perform security exercises, such as red team vs blue team campaigns. Red teaming is hiring an external organization that continuously tries to 
        challenge your security and is establishing a local team that is in charge of stopping such attempts. 
        They perform mock attacks to help you protect against real attacks. Maintain a bounty program. </p>
